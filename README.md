# Remove `/system/bin/askey_tr` from your Dynalink 4K box

This removes `/system/bin/askey_tr`, a shady "remote management" binary
that automatically runs as root.
([more info here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/shady-process-in-my-dynalink-4k-box-possible-backdoor.4356491/)).

I've only tested this on my Dynalink 4K Box, rooted stock ROM.

To install, simply zip up this repo's contents and use Magisk Manager to install.

**Disclaimer**: I don't know what I'm doing. This is my first time creating a Magisk module.
You might brick your device. Good luck.
